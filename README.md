# Super Mario 64 Steam Deck Builder and Launcher
Super Mario 64 PC port builder and launcher for Steam Deck. **Please put your legally-dumped ROM in `$HOME` and name it to `baserom.us.z64`, `baserom.jp.z64`, or `baserom.eu.z64` depending on the region of the ROM.** Otherwise, the program won't run.

To use the builder, simply right-click the [desktop file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxgamingcentral/sm64-steam-deck-builder/main/sm64-builder.desktop), click "Save link as..." and save it to your desktop. Double-click or tap the downloaded file to run it.

**Please install the build dependencies first under the Options menu.** You will need a root password for this. After installing the dependencies you should no longer have to run this again, unless Valve ships an update to SteamOS.

Forks that you can download and run include:
- the original [SM64 port](https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port)
- [SM64EX](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex)
- [SM64EX-ALO](https://github.com/AloUltraExt/sm64ex-alo)
- [SM64Plus](https://github.com/MorsGames/sm64plus)
- [Render96](https://github.com/Render96/Render96ex)

With this you can also:
- update or uninstall each fork
- edit the config file for each fork (using a text editor, for now)
- add forks as non-Steam shortcuts
- download [SM64 Reloaded](https://evilgames.eu/texture-packs/sm64-reloaded.htm) for hi-res textures
- backup save files

SM64 PC port builds are downloaded to the `$HOME/Applications/` directory.

## Known Issues
Render96 may have building issues.

## To-Do
- add more forks
- allow the user to edit config files with an easy-to-use GUI
- [x] ~~add the ability to add forks as non-Steam shortcuts~~
